group-cells
===========

A Google Apps Script for grouping related cells on a Google Spreadsheet.

I wrote this script for a Google Spreadsheet that was being used to track contacts from hundreds of different companies. It groups contacts that belong to the same company and sorts the active sheet by the status of each company (contact group) rather than by individual contacts.
