group-cells
===========

This repository contains scripts I've written to interact with data in Google Spreadsheets.

**invoicecalculator.js** (originally written 1/23/2013)

A Google Apps Script that calculates the amount of time you've spent working on multiple projects within a single billing period. It provides percentages based on the total number of hours worked.

**groupcells.js** (originally written 1/28/2013)

A Google Apps Script for grouping related cells. I wrote this script for a Google Spreadsheet that was being used to track contacts from hundreds of different companies. It groups contacts that belong to the same company and sorts the active sheet by the status of each company (contact group) rather than by individual contacts.
